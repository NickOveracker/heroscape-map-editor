# App Requrements

This app has to at least replace the functionality of Virtualscape, but ideally it needs to do fulfill much more.

## Must fulfill old roles from Virtualscape:

1. Offer printable/shareable build instructions
2. Track piece inventory
3. Verify basic physics (every piece has something underneath it, and is not duplicating a position with another piece)

## 2025 needs:

1. Easy to share maps
2. Usable from any device (not tied to Apple/Android/Xbox/Windows/Mac)
3. Be able to load old Virtualscape maps
4. Keep up with the new terrain packs
5. Validate piece placement slightly more thouroughly

## Nice-to-Haves:

1. Symmetry tools/guides. Efficiency tools (i.e. to show which tiles are completely covered and can be swapped for other pieces)
2. Random terrain generation (i.e. give me a snowy river, non-symmetrical, with a high point in the middle)
3. Multi-piece selection copy/paste/save
4. Multi-language translation for users around the globe
5. Animate the build process to give users an extra visual assist
6. Print design tools: Theming / beautifying / adjusting any printouts or build instructions
7. A way to export maps to current Heroscape sub-communities: OnlineHeroscape (Google Docs based), Tabletop Sim Mods
