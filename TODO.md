### Build & Editing Features  

3. Fast Hex Swap on Mouseover: Middle mouse button while hovering over a hex to make it the new active hex to draw with.
4. Fast Rotate: SHIFT + mouse wheel to rotate whatever is in your hand.
Using the arrow keys to rotate is fine, but if my hand is on the left side of the keyboard using WASD to move around, I'd like the option for a quick rotate by holding shift and scrolling the mouse wheel so I don't have to move my left hand.

### Multi-Select & Copy/Paste  
1. Selection Tool: Add a selection tool at the bottom. Functionally, you would click the selection tool, then click multiple hexes to highlight them. Then click the copy button. It would place in your hand what you just copied and then you can left click to place it in the world. Might need a reset button for when you are done copying to put one hex back in your hand.

### UI/ Settings
3. Customizable Hotkeys


## Local Storage Load/Save/Edit maps

Make a react component that can be shown in the modal like `CreateMapFormDialog.tsx`. The new component is for the user to save and load maps from local storage. They can also edit their local storage, to peruse and delete maps or other unused data stored in local storage. Some user settings may get saved there, and can be exported to a file/string and imported as easily.


When user clicks SAVE/LOAD, show:
    1. free space: KB unused capacity in local storage
    2. unavailable space: KB used capacity in local storage that is not a hexoscape map that can be saved or loaded
    3. map space: individual map objects of type MapFileState, their unique id can be their key, we can validate them with a function
        * SAVE => Select map to overwrite if there is an existing key that matches the id of the map being saved, or save as a new map key in local storage 
        * LOAD => Load selected map, user may select a map object from the list
        * EDIT => Delete button for items in local storage, the delete button changes its text and turns red to verify and requires one more click to actually delete.
